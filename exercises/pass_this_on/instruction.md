# Pass this on

It's more funny writing code than testing code... :) 

The AVA structure is pretty simple. If we use ES6 especifications we can create a test using arrow functions

```js
  test('My first test using AVA', t => {
	  //Instructions
  });
```
Let's start writing a test that always passes. You can do that using:

```js
  t.pass();
```
